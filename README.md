# Article titles classification

This is just a simple text classification repo: entering a title and the models output one of the classes "science and technology", "entertainment", "business", "medical". I wrote the models in `pytorch` and `pytorch-lightning`.

I create this repo just to learn using FastAPI and Docker.

Hope you can learn something here. I am quite a novice so any issue is welcomed.
